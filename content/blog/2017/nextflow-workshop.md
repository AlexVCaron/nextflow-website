We are excited to announce the first Nextflow workshop that will take place at the 
Barcelona Biomedical Research Park building ([PRBB](https://www.prbb.org/)) on 14-15th September 2017. 

This event is open to everybody who is interested in the problem of computational workflow 
reproducibility. Leading experts and users will discuss the current state of the Nextflow 
technology and how it can be applied to manage -omics analyses in a reproducible manner. 
Best practices will be introduced on how to deploy real-world large-scale genomic 
applications for precision medicine.

During the hackathon, organized for the second day, participants will have the 
opportunity to learn how to write self-contained, replicable data analysis 
pipelines along with Nextflow expert developers.

The registration form is [available here](http://apps.crg.es/content/internet/events/webforms/17502) (deadline 15th Jun). 


See you in Barcelona!
